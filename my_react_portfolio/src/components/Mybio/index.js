              I'm Nigar and I'm 28 years old. Originally I'm from Baku, Azerbaijan. I speak four languages: English, Russian, Azerbaijani, Turkish and have bachelor degree in Economy. Last August I moved to Chicago with my two beautiful kids. Before in my home country, I had been working in the bank system for the six years, and was a Head of Electronic Payments Division, but after moving to the US, I decided to start something new in my life and began to learn coding.And now I'm attending a NW bootcamp classes. I'm very exited about my final result, because it is a big challenge for me. At the same time I'm studing Business Administration in the Midwestern Career College.  In my free time I enjoy reading, cooking, traveling and collect lego/puzzles with my kids.
